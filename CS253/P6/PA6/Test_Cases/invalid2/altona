Heritage pier[edit]
Altona Pier is a heritage listed pier that was originally constructed c.1888 with later modifications.[2] It is located at the intersection of the Esplanade and Pier Street.

Recreation[edit]
The end of Altona Pier, is a common fishing spot for many local anglers who live around the area. The western side of the Pier is a great place for kite surfing and it is fairly common to see lots of these surfers in the water throughout the year. Body-boarding and surfing are not common at Altona Beach as for most of the year the water is fairly calm, with small waves only appearing whilst a strong southerly is blowing.

Marine Life[edit]
Animals found around the beach include:

Seagulls
Jelly Blubber
Snapper
Gummy shark
Toadfish
Stingray
Weedy Seadragon
Leatherjacket fish
Black Swans
